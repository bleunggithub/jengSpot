### Problems

- Travellers to HK would like to have a local experience while exploring HK, but there are too much information out there and are too scattered, it's easy to get overwhelmed.
- Locals who like to explore the city's hidden gems have no centralised platform to write about their experience, thus the lack of motivation to share their best finds with the public
